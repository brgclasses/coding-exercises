# Make page semantic

If you open the [index.html](index.html), you will find few non-semantic html tags like `div` with `id`.

## Tasks

- Change the `div` with `id` to its semantic names like `header`, `main`, `section` or `article`. See [Required Knowledge](#required-knowledge) section to know more on Semantic tags.

## Expected Output

__NOTE:__ Even after changing the div to its semantic names, the output should be same.

## Required Knowledge

- See [Semantic Tags](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp){:target="_blank"}

## Starter code

- [index.html](index.html)

__NOTE:__ Internal CSS is used using `style` tag for convenience here.
